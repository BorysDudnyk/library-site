                        <div class="history-of-the-krl">
                            <p>Founded on June 18, 1872 as a public, Kherson regional universal scientific library became one of the first publicly accessible provincial book collections in Ukraine.</p>

                                <div>
                                    <p>The library owes its birth to the progressive intelligentsia of the city. The idea of its creation belongs to the brother of the famous artist Mykola Ge - Hryhoriy Mykolayovych. This idea was supported by the city authorities and the most advanced of the influential citizens. Among the founders of the so-called library society, along with enthusiasts, was the local governor, General Sokrat Ivanovich Starinkevich.</p>
                                    <p>Thanks to the energy and knowledge of the people who were part of the first staff of the directorate, the library developed successfully.</p>
                                </div>
                            </div>
                            <p>Already in the 90s of the XIX century. in Kherson, where there was no higher education institution, a public library was formed, which ranked seventh in the empire in terms of the composition of its funds, and second in terms of the number of published books, second only to the Kharkiv Public Library. The funds were extremely rich.</p>

                            <p>In 1897, a special building was built according to the individual project of the academician-architect M. K. Tolvinskyi (21 Sichnia St., 24). The library was housed in this building until 1987.</p>
                            <p>During and after the civil war, the library directed its efforts to cultural and educational work and thus determined its place in the life of the city: its employees participated in the elimination of illiteracy, provided mobile libraries to military units, etc. In 1923, the library was reorganized into a state central city library and transferred to the state budget.</p>

                        <h3>In his letter, the famous writer B. A. Lavreniev gave an assessment of the activities of the book collection in the early 1930s:</h3>

                            <p>"...In 1932, when I visited my native city, I visited, without a doubt, my first academy... The new librarians... carefully preserved this valuable heritage... and carried on the work, strengthening the library and expanding its collections. .. The library has become a real achievement of the entire population of Kherson...".</p>
                        </div>
                        <div class="advertisement1">
                            <p>In 1941, the library's book fund numbered more than 300,000 volumes, and it was used by almost 10,000 readers. During the fascist occupation, the library worked for some time, but the fund and property were looted by the occupiers and local looters. Literature that did not correspond to the spirit of the temporary regime was destroyed. More than 215,000 books were lost. Damage of 740,000 rubles was caused. (in the old calculation).</p>
                            <p>After the release, the work on the revival of the institution began. In 1944, in connection with the formation of the Kherson region, the library became a regional library. It has been a scientific library since 1966, and in 1984 it was granted the status of a universal scientific library.</p>

                            <p>At the beginning of 1987, the library moved to new premises on the picturesque banks of the Dnieper. A new page in her history has opened.</p>

                            <p>Noting the great merits of the outstanding writer and academician Oles Terentiyovych Honchar to the Ukrainian people, the Cabinet of Ministers of Ukraine on February 18, 1997 decided to name the Kherson Regional Universal Scientific Library after Oles Honchar (Resolution No. 173 of February 18, 1997).</p>
                            <p>And this is no accident, because not only the work of Olesya Terentiyovych is connected with the Kherson region, but also his social activities. He was elected several times as a deputy of the Verkhovna Rada of the Ukrainian SSR in electoral districts of the Kherson region, always helped the residents of our region in solving various life problems, often visited the region (you can read more about this in the project "Gonchar and Kherson region"). It was thanks to the care of Oles Honchar that the modern premises of our library were built.</p>
